                <h3>Participating in Institute</h3>
                    <p>Participating in institute is a privilege, and we welcome you. You agree to
                        comply with institute policies and also agree that Seminaries and
                        Institutes of Religion, a department of Corporation of the President of
                        The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and its affiliated legal
                        entities (collectively “we”) are not responsible for any harm that may
                        result from your failure to comply with these policies.</p>

                    <h3>Student Information Privacy Policy</h3>
                    <p>You agree that we may collect and process your personal information
                        from this form and from your membership record (if you are a member
                        of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) for purposes related
                        to your enrollment and participation in institute and to respond to
                        questions or issues that may arise while you are in institute. You
                        understand that your personal information may be transferred to
                        Church headquarters in the United States, and you consent to this
                        transfer, if applicable. Your personal information may be retained
                        indefinitely as part of a permanent Church historical record. We will
                        never sell your information. We use technical and organizational
                        measures to protect the personal information we receive against loss,
                        misuse, and unauthorized alteration and to protect its confidentiality.</p>
                    <p>Research studies and surveys: If you are asked to participate in a
                        research study or survey, you understand that participation is entirely
                        voluntary and that you may withdraw at any point. Any personal
                        information you provide as part of a research study (for example, email
                        address or mobile phone number) will be used only for the purpose of
                        contacting you about participating in future studies or surveys. You may
                        opt out of receiving such contacts.</p>

                    <h3>Release to Use Image</h3>
                    <p>We may have occasion to film or record you in connection with institute.
                        Likely uses include, but are not limited to, distance learning activities,
                        teacher training, and photos or videos in yearbooks, firesides, bulletin
                        boards, websites, or social media. To this end, you assign and irrevocably
                        grant to us the right and permission to use and—without limit to time,
                        number, language, geography, and/or medium (including now unknown
                        and future media)—reproduce, distribute, display, perform, create
                        derivative works from, or sublicense any images or recordings made of
                        you in connection with institute. You authorize us to use or record your
                        name, voice, image, likeness, and performance; to interview and record
                        your interview; and to copy, reproduce, adapt, edit, and summarize any
                        recording for use at our discretion. You authorize the reproduction, sale,
                        copyright, exhibition, broadcast, electronic storage, and/or distribution of
                        images or recordings without limitation, at our discretion. You hereby
                        release us from any and all liability from such use and publication, and
                        you waive any right to compensation for any of the foregoing.</p>

                    <h3>Internet and Online Use Policy</h3>
                    <p>We provide a number of electronic resources to enable your participation in institute. You can decide whether to use these resources, but if
                        you do, you accept the following conditions:</p>
                    <p>When you access the internet using our facilities, equipment, or wireless
                        technology, we may collect information from your web browser. This
                        information may include your IP address, browser type, operating
                        system, and language preference; any referring web page you were
                        visiting before you came to our site; the date and time of each visit; and
                        information you search for on our sites. We also use cookies and clear
                        GIFs to collect information online. You can change your web browser
                        setting to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a
                        cookie from the sites you visit. If you configure your web browser setting
                        to not accept cookies or clear GIFs, however, you may not be able to use
                        some sections or functions of our sites.</p>
                    <p>The websites, software, content, servers, and other technologies and
                        materials we use to deliver institute programs (“Institute Tools”) are
                        owned or licensed and operated by us. We may monitor all communications (email, text messages, social media, and so forth) that use or take
                        place within Institute Tools for inappropriate or illegal content and may
                        forward them to ecclesiastical leaders or law enforcement officials as
                        needed to protect students and Church interests. You consent to this
                        monitoring and forwarding. Although we may monitor some communications, we cannot monitor all communications. Electronic communications are not secure. We do not guarantee that you will not be exposed
                        to unwanted messages, material, viruses, or other malware. Messages
                        containing inappropriate content may be deleted without notice and
                        may not be sent to intended recipients. You agree that you will not send
                        or resend any message that is obscene, defamatory, illegal, or hateful or
                        that infringes or violates the rights of others. Institute Tools may be used
                        only for communicating with other students, teachers, and ecclesiastical
                        leaders regarding gospel-related topics and events. You may not
                        download, redistribute, or post (for example, on YouTube or Facebook)
                        any text, image, sound, or video file from Institute Tools.</p>
                    <p>We are not liable for any damages (including lost data) caused by your
                        use of, or your inability to use, Institute Tools or any materials or
                        messages provided therein or by other users or linked sites. Institute
                        Tools are provided “as is.” We disclaim all express or implied warranties,
                        including warranties of title, merchantability, and fitness for a particular
                        purpose. We do not warrant that the functionality of Institute Tools will
                        be uninterrupted or error free, that defects will be corrected, or that any
                        website or server that makes Institute Tools available is free of viruses or
                        other harmful components.</p>

                    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
                    <p>You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations in your
                        area, but this Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah,
                        USA, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. Any legal action
                        brought to enforce this Agreement or relating to institute shall be
                        brought in the state or federal courts located in Salt Lake County, Utah,
                        USA, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of
                        such courts. If any provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void, or
                        unenforceable in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall not be
                        affected unless we determine that the invalid or unenforceable provision
                        is an essential term to the Agreement, in which case we may, at our sole
                        discretion, amend the Agreement.</p>
                    <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Agreement, please
                        email your concerns to siregistration@ldschurch.org, or contact your
                        local institute administrator.</p>
