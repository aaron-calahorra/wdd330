It was sort of a review from last semester using, when I improve my JS skills.\n\nFirst, I wrote the content of my portfolio in an HTML file. This helped me stay organized and style faster. I was able to review the example provided by our teacher, and this gave me a better idea on how to develop this assignment.\n\nIn order to maintain simplicity and a clean code, I decided to use an external JSON file to store everything each week.\n\nNo questions came up this week."
